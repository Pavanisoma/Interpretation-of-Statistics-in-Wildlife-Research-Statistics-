# Interpretation of Statistics in Wildlife Research Statistics
There is a huge amount of research happening on the wildlife population, but they add little value in real life. Most of the studies do not give correct conclusions because of many reasons. One must be choosing inappropriate sample size. Misjudging extreme data points in the data present. Lack of understanding of statistical and biological significance on information and its importance in hypothesis testing. 

This paper describes how statistical hypotheses are often viewed and then explains how it has to be viewed. Model Selection, Randomization and Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing are discussed in this paper.
